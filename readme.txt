This project was to investige cucumber rather than using dunit for writing tests. 

Notes: I would need to implement a lot of mapping using RTTI to finish this project off.  I think i will leave the project here, and leave it alone.
Note: I quite like the readability of the tests writting in cucumber, i'm going to try and write my tests in future using the given when then syntax, but in the native language of the code i am testing as the tests seem to run faster that way.
